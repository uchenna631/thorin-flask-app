    "description": "Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to Dwarf prince Thr√°in II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet 'Oakenshield,' which would remain with him even in death. Thorin became King-in-Exile of Durin's Folk in TA 2850 after his father went missing, and died in the dungeons of Dol Guldur.",

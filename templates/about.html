    <p>
        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest
        in recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when
        Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
        Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
        Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
        action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned
        to leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>
                Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth, he
                and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While in exile, he
                quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in
                TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his
                shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield,"
                which would remain with him even in death.[2]

                Thorin became King-in-Exile of Durin's Folk in TA 2850 after his father went missing, and died in the dungeons of
                Dol Guldur.

            <h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
            <p>
                Fíli and Kíli were brothers, the youngest of the thirteen Dwarves who set out with Thorin
            Oakenshield's company, along with Gandalf and Bilbo Baggins, to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon
            Smaug.

            Fíli and Kíli were the two most active Dwarves of Thorin's company, and apart from Balin, and possibly
            Bombur, they appeared more frequently as "individual" characters in Tolkien's novel than the rest of
            Thorin's companions, who were most often named only in "group" references to the entire company

            <h3>Oin</h3>
            <p>
                Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was
                Fundin, the father of Balin and Dwalin. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought
                in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and
                Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves
                who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin
                were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company as they were the most skilled out of the
                others. He fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain
                with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of The Company of Thorin.

            <h3>Glóin</h3>
            <p>
                Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin
                and younger brother of Óin.

                In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of
                the Dwarves and Orcs, though it is unknown how significant his contribution was, being 16 years old.

                In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In
                March of TA 2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin
                to reclaim Erebor, so that Smaug wouldn't ally with Sauron. When Gandalf mentioned Hobbits, Glóin
                referred them as "simpletons" and also said that Hobbits "would never dare to come within smelling
                distance of the nakedest dragonet new from the shell".

            <h3>Balin</h3>
            <p>
                Balin was a Dwarf leader, the son of Fundin, and elder brother of Dwalin. He was one of the thirteen
                Dwarves who accompanied Thorin II Oakenshield on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain.
                A Dwarf Lord known for his wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of Thorin's closest
                friends and advisers. Balin was distantly related to him, and a descendant of the noble House of Durin.

                He later went to re-establish the Dwarf presence in Moria, but within five years it was overcome once
                more by Orcs, and he was killed there along with the rest of his companions.
